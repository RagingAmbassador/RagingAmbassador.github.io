Hi, my name is Nick. I've been programming in one form or another since 2001. The main languages I work with are SQL and C#, but I'm also familiar with Visual Basic (both .NET and VB6). My day job consists of customizing, automating, and supporting a 3rd party MSSQL-based 3D plant modeling software. I am currently trying to migrate many years worth of on-the-fly database modifications into a Visual Studio SQL project in order to better mitigate future changes as our department (and databases!) grows.

In my personal time, I like to learn new things (such as Jekyll, which is why this page is here!) as I can. I have some projects that I'd like to try to put into motion, but time will tell if I will be able to get to those. In the meantime, maybe I can find a project or two to contribute to here on github...

Thanks for taking the time to check me out! Feel free to say hi...

Nick
